            <p>MasterStudy used is an excellent workshop wheter you come as a counselor, advisor, administrator, or
                faculty member. I am going home empowered. I am looking forward to attending the On Course
                MasterStudy and the MasterStudy National Conference next year and facilitating the use of this
                excellent retention/student success course at my college.</p>
